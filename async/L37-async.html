Default JavaScript Behavior:--

JavaScript -> 1. Synchronous ( Synchronous means one thing at a time then other thing like : one by one execution)
              2. Single Threaded 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Execution Context -> execute one line of code at a time , call stack , memory heap
                  -> console.log(1)
                  -> console.log(2)..etc
                  (each statement wait for the previous statement to complete before executing)

Blocking code VS Non-blocking code

Blocking code : block the flow of execution -> Read file sychronously , wait for the file to finish reading before executing the next line of code

Non blocking code : do not block the flow of execution -> Read file asynchronously , do not wait for the file to finish reading before executing the next line of code

Js Engine ( Memory Heap , Call Stack )

* Async in JavaScript
* Definition:
Async (Asynchronous) in JavaScript refers to the ability to execute non-blocking operations, allowing the program to continue running other tasks while waiting for certain operations (like API calls or file reading) to complete.

Short Notes on Given Topics

* Default JavaScript Behavior:

Synchronous: Executes one task at a time, in a sequential order.
Single-threaded: JavaScript runs on a single execution thread, meaning it can only handle one task at a time.

* Execution Context:

Executes one line of code at a time.
Uses Call Stack (for function execution) and Memory Heap (for storing data).
Example :
console.log(1);  
console.log(2); // Executes only after the first line is completed.


* Blocking vs. Non-blocking Code:

Blocking Code: Stops further execution until the current task is completed.

const fs = require('fs');
let data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt'); // Blocks execution until file is read
console.log(data);


Non-blocking Code: Allows other tasks to run while waiting for completion.

fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => console.log(data)); // Doesn't block execution
console.log('Reading file...');


* JavaScript Engine (Memory Heap & Call Stack):

1. Memory Heap: Stores objects and variables.
2. Call Stack: Manages function execution in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order
   exp : 
function first() {
  console.log("First");
}
function second() {
  console.log("Second");
}
first(); // Pushed to Call Stack, executed, then removed.
second(); // Same process.
