AJAX API Response Handling (Revision Notes)

API Request:
Uses XMLHttpRequest to send a GET request to GitHub API (https://api.github.com/users/AnkitSoni03).

State Monitoring:
Logs xhr.readyState to track request progress.
Executes logic when xhr.readyState === 4 (request completed).

Response Handling:
Initial Issue:
this.responseText returns a string, not an object.
Direct access like result.following fails (undefined).

Fix: Convert response to an object using JSON.parse().

Console Debugging:
Logs response type before and after parsing to understand data format.
Extracts and logs following count from parsed object.

V8 JavaScript Engine - Definition
V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google. It is written in C++ and is used to execute JavaScript code outside the browser. V8 powers Google Chrome, Node.js, and other applications.

Key Features of V8:

High Performance: Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to convert JavaScript into highly optimized machine code.
Memory Management: Implements Garbage Collection to manage memory efficiently.
Multi-Platform: Works on different OS like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Standalone Execution: Allows JavaScript to run outside the browser (e.g., in Node.js).
Optimized Execution: Uses Hidden Classes, Inline Caching, and TurboFan to optimize JavaScript performance.

Why is V8 Important?
It makes JavaScript execution faster and efficient.
Enables server-side JavaScript with Node.js.
Used in Chrome, Deno, MongoDB, and Electron.
In simple terms, V8 is the engine that makes JavaScript fast and powerful. ðŸš€
